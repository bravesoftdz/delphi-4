The goal of this project is to create a content aggregator that would run on Google App Engine Platform. The application allows a user to create an account and specify a set of keywords and a number of content sources (e.g., The Guardian, Google News, Yahoo News etc). The user then receives periodic updates via email and SMS if there is any new content that is related to his interest.
